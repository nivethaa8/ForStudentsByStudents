           <p> There are several levels of comprehension and each has its role to play. </p>
        <h1>Reading With Care</h1>
            <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513475382585-d06e58bcb0e0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli"style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #6EC650; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
            <p>First, the most superficial reading or thinking is like reading math equations, many textbook descriptions, phone book
pages, stock tickers, most weather reports, etc.</p>
    <ul>
    <il><p>You read it, you might memorize it, you might use the information, but you really do not think too much about
the information and it does not create any emotional or personal angst or issue. Neither does it generate any
intellectual a-haa! or intellectual reaction.</p></il></ul>
    <p>Second, you might read something (or hear or see something) and it <b>creates a response.</b></p>
            <p>Third, you read or experience something that creates an emotional or intellectual response, but you start <b>reflecting and
enquire as to why it registered such a response.</b></p>
    <ul>
        
            <il><p>Why did you find it funny? Why did you find it annoying? This is the start of a higher level of comprehension,
thinking, and cognitive skill. You are aware of the response and start to think about causal relationships – that
made me laugh, why? This level can be superficial or a bit deeper. For example, I know I laughed because the
author used a funny example. I know it was ‘funny’ and that is why I laughed. That is a superficial level of
analysis. Why do you find it funny? Is it a cultural bias? Is it a slapstick example of humour with a face plant into a
wall? If you laugh at something, why?</p></il></ul>
            <p>Fourth, you register the response, are aware of what might have made you respond, and you also think about the intent
of the author.</p>
    <ul>
    <il><p>Was the response planned? Was it a conscious and planned structure that created the response? The author
used clever puns or clever wording or certain circumstances, or the author accidentally created a situation that is
funny when other information is known.</p></il>
    </ul>
<p>Fifth, if it was a conscious effort by the author, <b>why?</b></p>
    <ul>
    <il><p>Why did the author want us to feel or react this way at this point in time, and the reaction caused by this type of
mechanism? Why did the author choose the method to elicit this specific response? Why this response? Why
not a different method? Why not a different response? Why any response? Why? The response might be
emotional or it might be an intellectual point of enlightenment – this is the deeper a-haa! point. But be careful
and do not try to read more into it than is there. The author might not have been thinking deeper. Like some
paintings - blue was chosen because the paint can was closest, open, looked nice – it did not mean anything else.</p></il>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are reading for a purpose, analysis, or learning – and you wish to be an efficient and effective learner or analyst – you
need to develop the skills to quickly assess what you read and be aware of what you read. If a reaction, intellectual or
emotional, occurs, what triggered it? What was the a-haa!, eureka!, or wow! trigger? Why did such a trigger result in such a
reaction? Was the trigger conscious and intentional, or was it accidental? If it was conscious and intentional, why?</p>
    <p>At each level you should be able to demonstrate your comprehension (e.g., putting ideas into your own words, developing
an example, etc.). <b>As the levels increase, this is where expertise is demonstrated</b> – the descriptions are richer, deeper, more
insightful. It takes time and deliberate practice to reach each level. It is a journey of enlightenment.</p>
