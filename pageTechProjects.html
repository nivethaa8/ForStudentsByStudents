    <h1>Picking Technology for Capstones/ Major Projects</h1>
    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #5AC4B9; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>

    <p>
        There are sometimes when you get to choose the technology you use for a project deliverable. The instructor leaves it to your reasonable judgement. Often there are many choices to choose from.
    </p>
    <h1>Here are some observations:</h1>
    <p>Remember that the goal of most assessments is to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of the course material. </p>
    <ul>
        <il><p>Does the technology you want to use do this? </p></il>
        <p><il>Be able to explain why you chose it over other tech</il></p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p><il>Do you have a criteria?</il></p>
        <il><p>Did you consider other tools?</p></il>
    </ul>
    <p>How much experience do you and others have with the technology?</p>
    <p>Do you have a way to get help if you get in over your head? Get confused? Is there a community of practice within your peer group or otherwise to turn to?</p>
    <p>Do you have a backup plan if you choose the wrong technology?</p>
    <p>How stable and robust is the technology? Using buggy or flaky software or hardware is not a good choice.</p>
    <p>Do you expect use of the project deliverable after the course? </p>
    <ul>

        <il><p>Does the technology satisfy this goal?</p></il>
        <il><p>Does someone else inherit or have to use the technology? Do they already use the tech? Do they need to buy or learn the tech?</p></il>
        <il><p>Who will support the project?</p></il>
        <il><p>Are there any issues with academic vs commercial use?</il>
    </ul>
    <p>How many people on the ‘team’ need to know the tech? Do you have a single point of failure?</p>
    <p>Identify what features and functions are solid and get the job done vs being glitzy and ‘bling’.</p>
    <p>If the tech is relatively new or critical:</p>
    <ul>
        <il><p>Identify your help or information resources early on.</p></il>
        <il><p>Try some early prototyping.</p></il>
        <ul>
            <p><il>End to end process - a real skinny system</il></p>
            <p><il>	Not all aspects but something of everything to identify risks and issues ASAP.</il></p>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1>Trips and Tricks for Online Learning</h1>
    <p>Online learning is a big jump from the norm and oftentimes you may experience uncertainty (e.g. not knowing how content will be delivered, being unsure about how exams or labs will go, etc.). It is an adjustment that can be difficult at first, but online learning also comes with some pros that in-person classes do not have. </p>
    <p><b>The Pros and Cons</b></p>
    <table id="proscons">
        <tr>
            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The ability to study on your own time and create a schedule that works for you.</td>
            <td>Hard to develop connections with profs and TAs</td>
            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The ability to replay or speed up lectures as needed (if lectures are recorded).</td>
            <td>Harder to meet and connect with classmates and faculty </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Midterm and final exams may not be weighted as heavily. </td>
            <td>Different professors may use different tools for communication and this can make it more difficult to keep up with announcements, deadlines, etc. </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><b>Possible Forms of Course Delivery</b></p>
    <p>(These are some ways your professors might run your classes but know that the deliver is not limited to this list)</p>
    <ul>
        <p><b>Lectures:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <il><p><b>Live lectures</b> - Live sessions where the professor facilitates the lectures in real time (often times these must be recorded and posted afterwards) </p></il>
            <p><il><b>Pre-recorded lectures</b> - The professor has recorded a video of themselves going through the content and posts that so students can view (may be posted on Learn, Youtube, etc.)</il></p>
            <il><p><b>Assigned readings</b> - The professor may assign textbook reading to supplement the topics covered in the above methods of delivery. </p></il>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Tips:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <il><p><b>Get organized:</b> during the first week try to understand the schedule (deadlines, potential live sessions, and other important dates) of each of your courses. This will minimize the risk of letting important tasks slip through the cracks.</p></il>
            <il><p><b>Be engaging:</b> if your professor provides a course survey or asks for feedback, use that opportunity to let the faculty know whether or not the delivery of the course and assignments are working for you or not. The professors and TAs are also learning how to navigate the online space and are often very reciprocated of your feedback.</p></il>
            <il><p><b>Set up channels for accountability: </b>if you know someone in your class, consider syncing up (via call or text) with them once a week to go over what assignments are coming up and other important dates. </p></il>
            <il><p><b>Take advantage of technology: </b>consider using online organization/productivity tools like Notion to list out important dates, a weekly agenda, upcoming assignments, etc. </p></il>
            <il><p><b>Don’t let work pile up:</b> even though your learning is on your own terms it is good to set a schedule for yourself to stay on top of course work. It is harder to catch up after the fact.</p></il>
            <il><p><b>Plan ahead:</b> Look for major upcoming deadlines that will require a significant amount of time to invest in. You don’t want to get stuck last minute pulling all-nighters to complete assignments for the due date.</p></il>
            <il><p><b>Don’t be afraid to ask for help:</b> Online learning may be stressful, but don't be afraid to ask for help. Ask classmates, professors and TAs for help, they will be glad to help you out.</p></il>
            <il><p><b>Get co-op under control:</b> Co-op deadlines can creep up on you fast and is one more thing to worry about during the term. Try to arrange your own job early in the term to avoid having interviews taking up a significant amount of your time</p></il>
        </ul>
