           <p> For a long, successful, sustained career it is important to be able to learn on your own.
        </p>
    <p>It is also important to realize what is feasible and infeasible for you to do – and pick wisely! <b>Success in a field usually depends on what you pick (or are assigned) and your ability to do it. </b>Sometimes it is following your skills instead of following what others say or what “you’re supposed to do”. It is like when you are working with data: you have to go with what the data tells you, not what you want the data to tell you.

            <ul>
    <il><p>Basically, you have to be able to figure out what you know, how well you know it, what you can do, what you cannot do, what you do not know and what you need to know
</p></il>
            <il><p>This requires that you need to be aware of your own thought processes, how you learn, and what different learning needs imply. </p></il>
                <il><p><b>To improve your life-long learning skills, you need to be able to think about, track, and evaluate them. </b></p></il>
                <p><il>Furthermore, proactive learning must be done to improve the knowledge and skill base without any direct motivation or incentive structure.</il></p>
             </ul>

        <p><il>
        Do I have to improve my search strategy to find better material to learn from? How do I do this?

        <p><il>Do I have to spend more time when learning on my own? How will I plan for this?</il></p>
            <p><il>What kind of conscious strategy can I, or should I, use to approach topics which are self-learned?</il></p>
            
        <p><il>TWhat did I do well? What did I find hard? How can I improve the weak parts of the process and improve the learning?
            </il></p>
            <p><il>If I found it hard to be motivated enough to spend sufficient time, then how can I think about the situation differently to create enough motivation?</il></p>
            <il><p>If I had trouble with the assumptions and making sense of the material, what can I do to improve that type of understanding?</p></il>
            <p><il>If I am going to have to do this for the next 30 to 40 years, what should I start thinking about to make it easier and more effective?</il></p>
