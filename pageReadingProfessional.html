    <p>
        Reading is another cognitive skill you will <b>need to master and deliberately practice.</b> We are not talking about being a ‘strong’
        reader, being able to read a sentence, recognize words, and stuff like that. Adler (1940) describes how to REALLY read
        different types of documents and publications. It is a classic (yes, humans have been reading for a long time!) and is a good
        starting point if you are interested in reading at a professional level. In post-secondary education, you have to be a
        professional reader. Upon graduation and entering the workforce, most situations require the graduate to be a professional
        reader. A professional reader comprehends what is written and understands it and knows if they do indeed comprehend
        (meta-cognition). The reader knows if something is expected of the reader, expected of others, if there are any special
        caveats or issues embedded in the material, and knows if there are any directions or qualifiers associated with the tasks.
    </p>
    <h1>Reading With Care</h1>
    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550399105-c4db5fb85c18?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1951&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #6EC650; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
    <p>
        In most cases, formal material needs to be carefully read - everything from word problems, assignment/project descriptions,
        to job ads, resumes, contracts, and specifications. Unless you are very well versed in the subject and similar writings, it is not
        wise to quickly read something once and then start on whatever actions you think are needed. You should read formal
        material several times - especially when starting out or when the risks associated with misreading the piece are substantial.
    </p>
    <p>Here is one strategy for improving comprehension and understanding on ‘wordy’ questions and term projects:</p>
    <il>
        <p>
            The first pass should be relatively quick and skimming. The purpose of the first pass is to get the main point and get
            the big picture. In the case of a question, the student needs to size up the basic topic and the type of assessment
            that is being asked for; same for a project.
        </p>
    </il>
    <il>
        <p>
            The second pass involves going back through the material and identifying any ‘deliverables’ which you are expected
            to deal with. Do not worry about these on the first pass - focus on the topic, what you might know about the topic
            and what you do not know. In the second pass process, note the dates and sequence of the deliverables. Also note
            any relevant facts and information that relate to the deliverables as objects. This can be format, naming conventions,
            style, voice, tone, etc. Once you get this stuff out of the way and parked where you cannot forget it later, you can
            focus on what is actually expected.
        </p>
    </il>
    <il>
        <p>
            <b>OHIO - Only Hit it Once</b> - If an email or other request comes in and takes 5+ minutes to do, do it immediateThe third pass (yes, a third pass) highlights any nouns, verbs, or adjectives that constrain or provide elasticity in the
            problem and solution space. This pass should also identify any emphasis words or phrases that imply order or
            priority. You are looking for specific words (i.e., the verbs) that define what you have to do - like ‘how to’ or ‘include’
            or ‘provide’. This is perhaps the most important pass to slowly and carefully do.
        </p>
    </il>


    <h1>Things You May Miss</h1>

        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553729784-e91953dec042?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" style="align:right; width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #6EC650; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;">
        <p>
            Without careful parsing of the question or project, it is unlikely that you can really understand what is expected of you. <b>
                You
                need to know if you are being asked to do something specific, create a specific answer, or develop and describe a process.
            </b>
            Too often students will see something like ‘how to analyse and control’, but really only get the ‘analyse and control’ and then
            proceed to create a nice answer to a different question. This happens all of the time. The reading is quick. The key words like
            ‘how to’ are overlooked. Here are a few specific tips:
        </p>

        <p><il>Phrases like ‘how to’ imply processes and methods - not a specific answer.</il></p>

        <p>
            <il>
                It is important for you to also pick up key words like could, should, would, can, may, or must. Phrases that imply
                minimums, maximums, priorities, and preferences are also important.
            </il>
        </p>
        <p>
            <il>
                There are two types of constraints that need to be understood as well. There are the constraints that force
                something within a space; it must be between a and b. There are also the constraints that force something out of a
                space; it cannot be between a and b.
            </il>
        </p>
        <p>
            <il>
                If the author took the time to use strong ‘words’ or other ways to emphasize something (e.g., diagrams) - it is
                probably important, so pay attention to it.
            </il>
        </p>
