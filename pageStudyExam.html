           <p> The following are a number of study tips. Some are ‘truths’ and some will or will not work for you. Which ones do you think are ‘truths’?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <il><p> <b>Pay attention in class</b> – often there is one key message or point to the lecture (perhaps 2-3) – at the end of the class write down what this key message or point was. Make sure you understand it. Confirm or review with the instructor if you are not sure. Always check your assumptions.
</p></il>
            <il><p><b>Read the syllabus and note when things are due.</b> If the deliverables are in the syllabus, you are responsible and the instructor does not have to mention them, or remind you.</p></il>
                
    <il><p>Eat a healthy breakfast. Drink lots of water. Set a morning routine so that your body starts on a good rhythm. If you find your productivity lagging due to fatigue, stop working and just go to sleep (even if it is a midday nap). 
</p></il>
            <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584601218757-8a412705aaa6?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli"style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #C39052; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
            <il><p>One hour of productive, well-rested studying is worth much more than two hours of studying when you are tired/stress/frustrated/struggling to stay awake.</p></il>
            
            <il><p>Really, really pay attention in class – what does the instructor repeat, what language is used (must, should, important, useful, critical, etc.) – this stuff is likely to be important, very important (think tests).</p></il>
            <p><il><b>Aim to complete all items in only one sitting.</b> Break large tasks into sub-tasks if required (e.g., research, writing and editing a report would be three separate tasks). Try to use ½, 1, 2, 4 hour estimates.</il></p>   
        <il><p>
            When doing a practice, make it a <b>REAL</b> practice. Take the old exam, find a quiet place like the exam setting, give yourself the same amount of time and resources then try it start to finish – like a real exam. Use a reasonable time of day (e.g., not 2 or 3AM). Create the same pressure. Use the same aids. Same type of calculator. Same formula sheet. Closed book is closed book - really. Then, and only then, look at the answers or talk to others.
        </p></il>

        <p><il>Actually buy and use the recommended course text book – <b>do the questions for each chapter.</b> Do not ask the prof for more practice questions if you have not done this first. Same goes for any posted resources like old mid terms. Look first before asking for the obvious. It might already be there. Sometimes not, but look first.  </il></p>
            
        <p><il>
        Do not just ‘read’ the chapters – try the worked out examples, do actual problems. Do them by yourself before comparing notes with your study buddy.
 </il></p>
              
        <p><il><b>Do not cram.</b> Students have been cramming for centuries and for centuries it has not worked. In fact, cramming can create anxiety and make things go worse. It might give the appearance of working, but it really doesn’t.
</il></p>
            
        <p><il>Go online for the courses you are having problems with – find courses and notes that describe the material in a different way, have different problems to try.
</il>
        </p>
            
        <p><il>Be aware of any styles or approaches used by the instructor during the term – what has been asked, how asked, how the instructor tried to engage the class – these may all be clues as to how things might be asked on the test.
</il></p>
         <p>If you have problems memorizing, create stories in your head about what you need to remember, craft mental cues, do more background reading so that you know and understand what you are asked to demonstrate, not just the ‘phrase’ or ‘definition’.
</p>   
            <il><p>In some cases, using the electronic tools is not the best way – writing things out by hand repeatedly can help vs typing it once or just taking a pic of the board. Writing a summary vs reading a summary forces different mental processes to kick in and this can create the necessary linkages for understanding and remembering. Hand drawn mind maps, fishbone, or KJ diagrams can also help (all are kinda the same if you think about it) – whatever works.</p></il>
            <il><p>Do not study for long periods without suitable breaks.
</p></il>
            <il><p>Do not study when you are tired and bouncing your head off the keyboard.</p></il>
            <il><p>Try to relax and not to study the night before or same day of the test – either you know it or you don’t. Skipping other classes (physically or in thought) is really bad. If you study and think about the material during the term, and deal with what you do not know when you should, you will not need to panic, cram, or pull all-nighters. </p></il>
            <p><il>Do something relaxing before the exam. Go for a light jog, play a game of cards, have a treat. Whatever lowers anxiety for you.</il></p>
