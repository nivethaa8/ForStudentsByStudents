                We hope that you find the site useful when you are <b>first transitioning</b> to the U: what to expect,
                what you can do to make the transition easier – this is one part of the site and will take you
                through a journey of what it might feel, look like as you start 1A.
            </p>
            <p>

                The other part of the site is more like a <b>first-aid station</b> – you have hit a
                speedbump, faceplanted on the wall and you need some ideas for how to deal with
                the crap you just landed in.
                Perhaps your study habits from high school do not work so well, perhaps you do not now how to best use the course TAs, perhaps you failed your first assignment or test, perhaps you are having trouble grasping with the challenge with co-op?
                Lots of possible bumps and scrapes as the term progresses.
                Once you know you have a challenge to deal with, the site might be able to help you, to minimize
                the impact, and to figure out a new, different strategy for being an university student.

            </p>
            <p>

                We will continue to enhance and improve the site; for example, making the transition material more of a journey.

        <h1 style="text-align: left"> From Whence It Came </h1>

        <br>
        <p>
            Starting in 2015, the introductory ‘concept’ course for the <b>Management Engineering</b>
            program at UW has been taught by Prof. Ken McKay and has focused on supporting the incoming 1A
            students transition from high school to the university experience as one of its main objectives. In 2019, the various messages and material associated with the course were gathered into 30 one-pagers shared with the F19 class. This packaging worked WAY better than the previous style for a number of reasons. Long story short, a joint initiative was launched with student volunteers, Housing, and the Centre for Teaching Excellence to make the material available to other students, not just Management Engineering.
            The students were involved because we wanted to make sure that the information and material
            was actually student friendly and helpful; <b>Housing</b> because of their focus on being a learning
            space and ‘touching’ about 75% of the first year students; and
            the <b>Centre for Teaching Excellence</b> to help make sure that the learning/teaching bits
            were solid and to help let instructors across campus know about the site – as a resource
            their students could use. We also got great help on the pages from <b>Erm Lombardi</b>, a certified coach who volunteered her time to help!
            <a href="https://ermlombardi.com/">(her site)</a>.

                I was responsible for the creation of the website, from the HTML to the CSS. I’ve created the pages on the website to help those who are or will be in University. Hopefully, it will help you during your time at University.
