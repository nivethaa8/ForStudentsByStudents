    <p>
      We hope that you find the site useful when you are first transitioning to the U: what to expect, what you can do to make the transition easier – this is one part of the site and will take you through a journey of what it might feel, look like as you start 1A. 
      The other part of the site is more like a first-aid station – you have hit a speedbump, faceplanted on the wall and you need some ideas for how to deal with the crap you just landed in. 
      Perhaps your study habits from high school do not work so well, perhaps you do not now how to best use the course TAs, perhaps you failed your first assignment or test, perhaps you are having trouble grasping with the challenge with co-op? 
      Lots of possible bumps and scrapes as the term progresses. 
      Once you know you have a challenge to deal with, the site might be able to help you, to minimize the impact, and to figure out a new, different strategy for being an university student.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> From Whence It Came </h1>
    <br>
    <p> Starting in 2015, the introductory ‘concept’ course for the Management Engineering program at UW has focused on supporting the incoming 1A students transition from high school to the university experience as one of its main objectives. In 2019, the various messages and material associated with the course were gathered into 30 one-pagers shared with the F19 class. This packaging worked WAY better than the previous style for a number of reasons. Long story short, a joint initiative was launched with student volunteers, Housing, and the Centre for Teaching Excellence to make the material available to other students, not just Management Engineering. 
      The students were involved because we wanted to make sure that the information and material was actually student friendly and helpful; Housing because of their focus on being a learning space and ‘touching’ about 75% of the first year students; and the Centre for Teaching Excellence to help make sure that the learning/teaching bits were solid and to help let instructors across campus know about the site – as a resource their students could use.</p><br>
    <p> We wanted the site to be facilitated by the groups, but the actual content and style to be ‘by students, for students’. The student volunteers worked over the winter of 2020 to edit and revise the material and have assisted with the site review and roll-out. We got ourselves an intern/co-op student from UW’s Digital Media Program and some more volunteer help. In terms of the site design, the credit goes to the students. The site is not for the old folks at the university, we probably have different ideas about how the site should look and feel like (haha).</p><br>
