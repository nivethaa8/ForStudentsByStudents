        <h1>Term and Course Planning</h1>
           
        
           <p> Taking time to plan out your term and the course you have each semester is an extremely valuable practice that will help you manage and make the most of your time. Listed below are some tips and tricks when it comes to planning your term:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli"style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #C39853; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
            
        <p><il>
            Assuming a course has twelve weeks of lectures on average, this implies that an average student should have approximately 108 hours outside of lecture time allocated per course over the twelve weeks – to deal with the necessary learning to perform at an average level on the various assessments. This is assuming the course loads to around 12 hours per week (144 total) and this includes 3 hours of ‘lecture’ time each week. Not all courses load that heavy and you can do the math as required. 

        </il></p>
        <p><il><b>Assume that for every hour of lecture time, one hour of non-class time is used to prep or review.</b> This leaves six hours per week specifically for the assessments in our example (no labs or tutorials). Over the term, this implies that 36 hours are used for preparing and reviewing each lecture, and that 72 hours are available for the other activities. (36 hours for lectures, 36 hours for proper prepping, and 72 hours for assessments = 144 hours)
  </il></p>
            
        <p><il>
            Map out ALL of the deliverables and special events (e.g., mid terms) – <b>know due dates, when you should start, and the rough effort required. </b>Have a big map for the term – showing all of the courses on one page. </il></p>
            
            
        <p><il>Know your instructor’s assumptions. If necessary, you might have to discuss effort vs marks and make sure that things are balanced when it comes to time taken to complete assignments.
</il></p>
            
        <p><il>Try to determine how many hours you need for assignments for each course and how many hours you need for other assessments per week leading up to midterms and finals.
</il>
        </p>
            <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516246843873-9d12356b6fab?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=975&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli"style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #C8AA5B; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
            
        <p><il>During the term, some courses will be heavier and lighter than others. There might also be times when there are conflicts and not enough hours in a week. If there are not enough hours, the tasks can be moved earlier – assuming it is known what is needed and that the necessary material has been explained in class or is understandable enough from readings. 

</il></p>
            <p><il>It is suggested that the planning and <b>time analysis start with the end of term and move backwards to the start of term.</b> If the planning and time allocation is limited by the available hours, the activity will identify the latest start time for the activity – in order to avoid extra effort or the infamous all-nighter.</il></p>
            <p><il>Contingency planning should also be done to account for stuff that will happen during the term that eats up time. It is logical to include some slack periods throughout the term and start activities before their latest start time. </il></p>
