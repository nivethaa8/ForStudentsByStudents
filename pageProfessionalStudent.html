    <h1>Best Practice - Succeeding as a Professional Student</h1>

    <p>
        At the post-secondary level, you should consider yourself a professional student and view the next five years as a ‘job’.
        Learning is work. Here are some of the things that help students benefit the most from their post-secondary education –
        the students being different/better than when they entered; coming up with different, better informed decisions. This is
        what we observe the best students understanding and doing. See Bain (2012) for additional ideas. The following points
        are in no particular order.
    </p>
    <h1>Work Habits</h1>
    <ul>
        <il>
            <p>
                a. You should <b>attend class and focus</b> on the class you are taking. Not everything is in the book and it is possible to
                actually benefit from the instructor’s expertise if you ask questions and probe the subtleties. Many instructors
                inadvertently signal what is important and what might be on the test if you pay attention. Pay attention if the
                instructor repeats something, uses key words like important, critical, or useful. What they slow down on. The
                examples they use. The common errors they mention. If something said in one class is referenced in a later one.
            </p>
        </il>
        <il>
            <p>
                b. You should <b>take good notes.</b> What happens in class comes fast, hard, and there is lots of it. Board work, slides,
                questions, answers, and the instructor speaking. You might think your memory is great or good enough. It isn’t.
            </p>
        </il>

        <il>
            <p>
                c. You should <b>go to office hours</b>, speak to your instructors one-on-one, ask questions, show interest. You will
                never be in an environment again with so many subject experts - take advantage of this unique opportunity.
                Use this option only when you need it. Self-regulating and knowing when to ask for help is key to a healthy
                school-life balance.
            </p>
        </il>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571260899304-425eee4c7efc?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #976936; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
        <il>
            <p>
                d. <b>Look at the material before class</b> and try to teach yourself something about the day’s topic. You will get more
                out of the effort you put into a course and the class time will be more efficient and effective. And, <b>
                    review the
                    material after class
                </b> - what confused you, what you do not understand, then deal with it.
            </p>
        </il>

        <il>
            <p>
                e. You will need to have <b>above average time management </b>if you want to avoid cramming and jamming all of the
                work into the last few weeks of term. Do not blame the instructors for the work load if you had ample time to
                do it when advised and you decided to procrastinate.<b> Do not cram. Do not pull all-nighters.</b>
            </p>
        </il>
    </ul>

    <h1>The Big Picture</h1>
    <ul>

        <il>
            <p>
                f. You should <b>reset your expectations</b> when you enter university. Most programs assume a 50-60 hour work week
                for an average student to get an average mark. This is not high school. Engineering at UW uses 60 hours. In the
                beginning, <b>take it slow. </b>Test the waters to see how much school takes up in your week. Slowly get more and
                more involved in extra-circulars and other activities once you get a better understanding of you school
                workload. Realize that your lifestyle from high school to University WILL change. You might have to do this every
                semester.
            </p>
        </il>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554415707-6e8cfc93fe23?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" style="align:right; width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #BC9C43; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;">
        <p>
            <il>
                g. Develop what is called a <b>growth mindset</b> if you do not have one (see Dweck 2017). You will need one –
                especially with the experiences most of you have had growing up in today’s world. Intentionally or not, today’s
                K-12 school system encourages a fixed mindset.
            </il>
        </p>

        <p>
            <il>
                h. Be mature and <b>be accountable</b> - understand what is your responsibility and be accountable for what happens if
                you shirk it. Do not blame others. Face it. Understand it. Accept it. Figure out how to avoid the mistake. Do not
                make the same mistake again.
            </il>
        </p>


        <p>
            <il>
                i. <b>Learn to fail, learn from failing</b> - while you can memorize facts, methods, and recipes, you cannot learn and
                develop key skills without failure, pushing yourself, persevering, expanding your comfort zone. Embrace failure
                when you use it for learning and growing. You are not a failure just because you fail.
            </il>
        </p>

        <p>
            j. Realize that for most knowledge based courses (see Bloom and Krathwohl 1956), <b>
                you can actually learn on your
                own
            </b> almost all of the topic from the course material and what is online. The basic facts and recipes. You are
            smart enough. Learn to read with purpose and teach yourself. Do not blame the instructor in knowledge based
            courses when you should be able to learn it yourself. After all, many knowledge classes have the instructor
            writing on the board what is in the text and then reading it aloud; what you should be able to do for yourself
            with respect to the facts and recipes. For the subtle interpretations and insights, you need to be in class!
        </p>


        <p>
            <il>
                k. <b>Learn what skills you need</b> to be a student and in your future career - develop them through deliberate
                practice. Only you can develop your skills. Practicing often is not fun. Do not expect it to be.
            </il>
        </p>

    </ul>

    <h1>General Tips</h1>

        <il><p>Initiate course contact, persist when confused or in doubt.</p></il>

        <il><p>Turn ‘best practice’ into a habit.</p></il>
        <il><p>Have realistic expectations – of the course and of yourself, the instructor is also nervous – not just you.</p></il>
        <il><p>Try to stay motivated – create mini-rewards, incentives.</p></il>
    </ul>

    <h1>When Things are not going 100%:</h1>

        <il><p>Know where, how to find resources.</p></il>
        <il><p>Don’t blame yourself, don’t blame others, keep focused, move forward.</p></il>
    </ul>
