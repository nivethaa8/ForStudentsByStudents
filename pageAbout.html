            What to do.
        </il></p>
        <p><il>What it should look like.
  </il></p>
        <p><il>
            How to do it. </il></p>
        <p><il>Who should do it.
            </il></p>      
        <p><il>Where it should be done.
</il>
        </p>
            <p><il>How it should be evaluated, assessed.</il></p>
            <il><p>Etc.</p></il>
            
            
        <p><il>During the term, some courses will be heavier and lighter than others. There might also be times when there are conflicts and not enough hours in a week. If there are not enough hours, the tasks can be moved earlier - assuming it is known what is needed and that the necessary material has been explained in class or is understandable enough from readings. 

</il></p>
            <p><il>It is suggested that the planning and <b>time analysis start with the end of term and move backwards to the start of term.</b> If the planning and time allocation is limited by the available hours, the activity will identify the latest start time for the activity - in order to avoid extra effort or the infamous all-nighter.</il></p>
            <p><il>Contingency planning should also be done to account for stuff that will happen during the term that eats up time. It is logical to include some slack periods throughout the term and start activities before their latest start time. </il></p>

    <h1>Skills and Skills Development</h1>
    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489533119213-66a5cd877091?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1951&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli"style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #dedede; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
    <p>Problem solving is a skill. A skill is the “ability to do something well” (Oxford Dictionary). From Cognitive Science, we know that skills do not improve much unless there is deliberate practice with feedback. Doing something for years and years does not mean it will be improved. Lots of self-reflection, feedback, and structure are needed to improve skills.
</p>
    <p>For each of these areas, we evaluate what “should” be done - knowing that “should” depends on the situation. The tools and methods to figure out the “should” are derived from information systems (the technology), organizational behavior (the people), and operations research (the math). During the next five years, you will learn many tools and methods to help you “do what <b>SHOULD</b> be done”. However, you must also learn to understand the situation and pick the appropriate approach, tool and method.
</p>
    <p>Expert professionals do not rely on luck. Repeated success relies on skills like:
</p>
    <ul>
    <il><p>Identifying a problem, requirement or opportunity</p></il>
        <p><il>Understanding the problem, second-level issues and technical requirements
</il></p>
        <il><p>Evaluating a problem, how big it is what it implies and if it should be dealt with or not</p></il>
        <p><il>Figuring out an appropriate level of efficiency and effectiveness</il></p>
        <p><il>Deriving or figuring out possible solutions</il></p>
        <p><il>Evaluating alternatives</il></p>
        <il><p>Designing and building (or otherwise procuring) the solution</p></il>
        <p><il>Deploying the solution, marketing, supporting it</il></p>
        <il><p>And many more</p></il>
    </ul>
    <p>Over time and with deliberate practice it is possible for an individual to develop many of these skills, but it is rare for one individual to have all the skills needed. Very rare. In the best organizations, you have the right people with the right skills doing the right things. This requires another skill - teamwork.</p>
    <h1>Business Applications</h1>
    <p>To perform highly in a business situation, you will eventually need to master three knowledge sources:
</p>
    <ul>
    <il><p>I.the specific mechanics and tools appropriate to the situation (e.g., project management methods, optimization methods, supply chain management, user interface design)
</p></il>
        <il><p>II.the general domain in which you are making decisions (e.g., automotive supply chain, metal forming, healthcare, hospitals, finance, online retail, mobile apps)
</p></il>
        <il><p>III.the specific context where it will all come together - the specific users, this factory, this hospital, this business, this product, this service</p></il>
    </ul>
