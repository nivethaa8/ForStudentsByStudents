        <h1>Being Successful</h1>
           
        
           <p> What does success mean? It is healthy to set goals and objectives which are not just ‘mark’ oriented. <b>No two people have the same definition of successful</b> and it is important to identify what you consider to be “successful” to help you grow more as a student, and ultimately a person. Despite this, there are a few characteristics that, as students, are common in successful students. These characteristics may seem geared toward academic success, but can also apply to success outside of the classroom.  
        </p>
    
        <h1>Characteristics</h1>
    <ul>
        <il><p>
            Take control of, and be interested in your own education.
        </p></il>

        <il><p>Go to lectures, prepare before lectures, engage the instructor during the lecture</p></il>    
        <il><p>Use your passion and interest to expand your knowledge and understanding – do not limit yourself to only “learn” what was officially taught or provided</p></il>
        <il><p>Learn in a deep and thorough way.</p></il>
        <il><p>Do not be afraid to fail, learn from your mistakes, try not to avoid failure (pay attention to the instructor’s feedback and use the feedback to improve).</p></il>
        <il><p>Address the lessons learned from mistakes so that you don’t make the same mistake multiple times</p></il>
        <il><p>DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP</p></il>
